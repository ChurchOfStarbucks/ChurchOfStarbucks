<h2>It's all about the feeds</h2>
  
<p>This community works closely with <a style="color:#00b0f4; text-decoration:none" href="http://twitter.com/webulite"><b>twitter.com/webulite</b></a> and our <a style="color:#00b0f4; text-decoration:none" href="http://twitrss.me/twitter_user_to_rss/?user=webulite"><b>RSS feed</b></a>. If you think of chat applications as places for realtime discussions, think of the Twitter/RSS feed as pointer to content which act as conversation starters for the discussions. Remember... in the long run, we want to promote blogging/podcasting (creating content), and our aggregated Twitter/RSS is one of the ways we hope to help you learn to promote your content. Sure, the channels are ok for discussing posts with a handful of others, but we want to help you promote your blogs/podcast, and enable you to talk with an even wider range of people, not just Discord people.</p>

  
<h2>Begin your journey...</h2>
  
<p>The first step is to connect your Twitter account to your Discord profile. Then, on your Twitter profile, save your blog/podcast URL into the "website" field. This way, clicking on your nickname in Discord, which shows your Discord profile, will provide a link to your Twitter page, and from there one can get to your blog/podcast, and eventually your RSS feed. Working on these steps will teach you most of what you need to know to then, complete your journey on your own.</p>


<h2>Ephemeral conversations</h2>
  
<script>
var len = 13;
var text = "";
var charset = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789";
for( var i=0; i < len; i++ )
  text += charset.charAt(Math.floor(Math.random() * charset.length));

document.write("<p><a  style='color:00b0f4; text-decoration:none' href='https://hack.chat/?" + text + "'><b>https://hack.chat?" + text + "</b></a> - is a link to an automatically generated temporary channel.</p>");

</script>
  
<p>We believe that chat should be ephemeral like real conversations, so our Discord server deletes channel posts after a short period of time (about a day). On Discord, your Direct Messages are not ephemeral. To overcome this you can use an alternate site for your DM conversations. Instead of holding your conversations with Discord DM, visit the link above, then pass the URL to the person you want to talk with (in a DM), and have them meet you there. Hack.chat can be useful to you even if you eventually leave Discord, so learning to use it, is worthwhile.</p>
