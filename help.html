<h2>Free blogging platforms (with RSS)</h2>

  <p><li><a href="https://twitter.com">Twitter.com</a> - If you currently don't have a Twitter account you should get one. It can be used initially as your blog. Later, it will serve other function, but since you will evenhutally need a Twitter account, you might as well start here if you currently don't have one. Plus, it's a good trial to see if your initeresed in blogging. If you can't blog a short 280 character post regularly, let's face it you probably are not cut out for blogging. So, before you take the time and effort to set up a more complex blog, try a little micro-blog first. Plus with a Twitter blog you can learn some of the mind set of blogging. </p>

  
  <p><li><a href="http://medium.com">Medium</a> - For complete newbies, I recommend this in combination with a Twitter account very highly. <a href="https://twitter.com/signup">Get yourself a Twitter account</a> first, and then immediately set up an assocated Medium account by identifying with your Twitter account. If your Twitter acount is @BobSmith your Medium blog URL will then be set up as medium.com/@BobSmith, and your RSS URL will automatically medium.com/feed/@BobSmith</p>
  
  <p><li><a href="http://wordpress.com">WordPress</a> - One of the most popular blogging platforms. Also, one of the more complex. Perhaps a good platform once you're experienced, but not the best platform to learn with.</p>
  
  <p><li><a href="http://blogspot.com">Blogger / blogspot</a> - owned by Google. Easier to use than WordPress, but it does have less features. Few downsides.</p>
  
  <p><li><a href="http://tumblr.com">Tumblr</a> - Originally bought by Yahoo, then sold to Verizon. Perhaps the easiest of all to use. A fine starter blog. But... Tumblr has some additional features that are not part of standard blogging platforms.</p>

  
  
<h2>Twitter is both a blog & messenging system</h2>
  
  <p><li><a href="https://twitter.com">Twitter.com</a></p>

  <p><li><a href="http://twitrss.me/">Twitrss.me</a> - Get an RSS feed URL for your Twitter feed.</p>
  
  <!--
  <p><li><a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/search/live?q=@webulite">Live Twitter search - example using @webulite</a></p>
  -->
  <p><li><a href="http://tweetdelete.net/">TweetDelete.NET</a> - Let's you set your Tweets to automatically delete. You have options like 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, etc...</p>

  <p><li><a href="http://tweetdeck.com">TweetDeck.com</a> - Excellent Twitter tool if you are using are on a screen larger than a mobile phone. It allows you, amoung other things, to see multiple columns of tweets so you can watch (for example) everyone you follow, a watch list, notifications, your tweets, and messages all in separate columns.</p>

  
  
  <h2>RSS & RSS Readers</h2>
  
  <p>An RSS Reader is a software program / application that let's you specify which blogs or podcasts you are interested in, and will automatically show you new content created by all the websites you "subscribe" to. think of it like Gmail for blogs & podcasts, where you get an item in your RSS Reader inbox any time a blog or podcast you're interested in creates a new item.</p>

  <p><li><a href="https://feedly.com">feedly.com</a> - an online RSS Reader.<p>
  
  
  <h2>It's not sexy, but it's universal, private & powerful</h2>

<p>Adding a link to allow folks to mail you from your blog/podcast allows you and your readers to talk together. Some prefer it to commenting systems, or social media because it is one-to-one, not speaking in a crowd. One of the things people find about comment systems, social media & chat is that trolls will often interject themselves into conversations, and then a crowd gets involved in a conversation, which diverts the original conversations. Think if it this way. If you're going to propse marraige to someone, do you do it in a crowd, or do you do it in private?</p>
  
  
<p>You can <a href="https://accounts.google.com/signup">create a gmail account for free</a>.  
  
  
  
  
  <h2>Learn by using the feeds</h2>
  
<p>This community works closely with <a href="http://twitter.com/webulite">twitter.com/webulite</a> and our <a href="http://twitrss.me/twitter_user_to_rss/?user=webulite">RSS feed</a>. If you think of chat applications as places for realtime discussions, think of our Twitter/RSS feeds as pointers to content which act as conversation starters for the discussions. Remember... in the long run, we want to promote blogging/podcasting (creating content), and our aggregated Twitter/RSS is one of the ways we hope to help you learn understand the connection between content & feeds. Sure, a chat is OK for discussing posts with a handful of others, but we want to help you learn to access content and talk with it's creators, not just on Discord, but on the entire internet.</p>

 
<h2>Ephemeral conversations</h2>
  
<script>
var len = 13;
var text = "";
var charset = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789";
for( var i=0; i < len; i++ )
  text += charset.charAt(Math.floor(Math.random() * charset.length));

document.write("<p><a href='https://hack.chat/?" + text + "'>https://hack.chat?" + text + "</a> - link to an automatically generated temporary chat.</p>");

</script>
  
<p>We believe that chat should be ephemeral like real conversations, so our Discord server deletes channel posts after a short period of time (about a day). On Discord, your Direct Messages are not ephemeral. To overcome this you can use an alternate site for your DM conversations. Instead of holding your conversations with Discord DM, visit the link above, then pass the URL to the person you want to talk with (in a DM), and have them meet you there. Hack.chat can be useful to you even if you eventually leave Discord, so learning to use it, is worthwhile.</p>
  
	  
<h2>Begin your journey...</h2>
  
<p>The first step is to connect your Twitter account to your Discord profile. Then, on your Twitter profile, save your blog/podcast URL into the "website" field. This way, clicking on your nickname in Discord, which shows your Discord profile, will provide a link to your Twitter page, and from there one can get to your blog/podcast, and eventually your RSS feed. Working on these steps will teach you most of what you need to know to then, complete your journey on your own.</p>
