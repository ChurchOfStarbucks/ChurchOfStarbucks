<p>For many people, using the web means using Facebook. For many others the term "social media" and "the web" are the same thing. Neither of these things are the case. This site will help you learn how to grow beyond Facebook, and use the actual internet. Whether you want to learn how to subscribe to blogs & podcasts on subjects you enjoy, talk online with others that share your interests, or become a blogger yourself, the links below can help you begin.</p>
	
<p>Another goal of this site is to show you how to control your content... so... we generally try to direct you to converstion tools that have the ability for you to set your posts to auto-delete, so that if you are adding content to someone elses server, you have the ability to set it up to dissappear after a set interval, or use services that allow mass deletion quickly and easily.</p>

<h2>Real-time chat - Slack</h2>
	
<p>If your a total beginner the web can be a lonely difficult place. So... while I dislike listing this feature at the very top, think of it as here at the top because it may be a starting point, and... if your new and over whelmed it needs, like a fire alarm to be easily found in emergencies. Feel free to join our Slack commuity. You can talk to others, and get help in virtually all aspects of using the web.</p>

<h2>Subscribing to / following content - RSS </h2>

<p>An RSS Reader is a software program / application that let's you specify which blogs/podcasts you are interested in (subscribed to), and will automatically alert you when new content is created on all of these, on a single page. Think of it like Gmail for blogs/podcasts, with a "inbox" showing new blog/podcast content for those you have subsribed to. Instead of visiting the site of every blog/podcast that your interested each day to see if they have posted anything new, you simply visit your RSS reader unread items page, and find everything new from all the blogs/podcasts you subscribe to.</p>

<p><a href="https://feedly.com">Feedly.com</a> - an online RSS Reader.<p>
	
<p>Here's a link for <a href="http://twitrss.me/twitter_user_to_rss/?user=webulite" target="_blank" title="Our RSS feed">@webulite tweets as an RSS feed</a> - this is just an example. A web site generally creates it's own RSS feed, but since this page doesn't really create it's own content, at least it's a URL you can start with if your testing out an RSS reader. Later... you'll pick some of the sites we tweet and use one or more of them in your own RSS reader environment.</p>

<h2>Creating content - website pages & blogging</h2>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com">Twitter.com</a> - Twitter can be initially used as your blog. Later, it can be used to also communicate with others. (<b><i><a href="https://twitter.com/webulite">Find our Twitter page here</a></i></b>) Plus... it's a good trial to see if you're really interested in blogging. If you can't blog a short 280 character post regularly, let's face it, you probably are not cut out for blogging. So, before you take the time and effort to set up a more complex blog, try a little micro-blog first. A Twitter blog also gives you the opportunity to gain experience of the mind set of blogging.</p>

<p><a href="http://medium.com">Medium</a> - For complete newbies, I recommend this in combination with a Twitter account very highly. <a href="https://twitter.com/signup">Get yourself a Twitter account</a> first, and then immediately set up an assocated Medium account by identifying with your Twitter account. If your Twitter acount is @BobSmith your Medium blog URL will then be set up as medium.com/@BobSmith, and your RSS URL will automatically medium.com/feed/@BobSmith</p>

<p><a href="http://wordpress.com">WordPress</a> - One of the most popular blogging platforms. Also, one of the more complex. Perhaps a good platform once you're experienced, but not the best platform to learn with.</p>

<p><a href="http://blogspot.com">Blogger / blogspot</a> - owned by Google. Easier to use than WordPress, but it does have less features. Few downsides.</p>

<p><a href="http://tumblr.com">Tumblr</a> - Originally bought by Yahoo, then sold to Verizon. Perhaps the easiest of all to use. A fine starter blog. But... Tumblr has some additional features that are not part of standard blogging platforms, so it will complicate understanding plain vanilla blogging.</p>

<h2>Talking with others - email</h2>
	
<p>It's not sexy, but it's universal, private & powerful.</p>

<p>Adding a link to allow folks to mail you from your blog/podcast allows you and your readers to talk together. Some prefer it to commenting systems, or social media because it is one-to-one, not speaking in a crowd. One of the things people find about comment systems, social media & chat is that trolls will often interject themselves into conversations, and then a crowd gets involved in a conversation, which diverts the original conversations. Blogs & podcasts are the tool to use when you want to say something to lots of people, email is better to say something to just one person.</p>
