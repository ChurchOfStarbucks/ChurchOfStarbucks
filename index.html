	<p>The internet has made online communities possible. Can we extend these communities into the physical world?</p>
	
	<p>We might try to raise money and build "club houses" in our towns, as various groups historically did, like the Elks, Masons, Veterans of Foreign Wars, Knight of Columbus, and Christianity did before that. But today, virtually everyone on earth already has a club house near them... it's called Starbucks. So why build a new building? Just use a local Starbucks when you have to physically meet, and do most of your stuff online with web tools.</p>

	<p>Did you know that the Greek word for church, "ecclesia", predates Christianity? In the Greek world it meant "community", and wasn't a religious term. We'll use the somewhat humorous phrase "Church of Starbucks" to refer to our concept. Sure, we can talk together online, but we'll also think of Starbucks as our club house... our home base... our physical meeting location... our church.</p>
