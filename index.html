	<center><h2>The Church of Starbucks is both a light hearted and serious idea.</h2></center>
	
	<p>The internet has enabled many online communities. What if we wanted to extend these online communities to the physical world? Well... we might want to make club houses. But... virtually everyone on earth already has a club house. It's called Starbucks.</p>
	
	<p>A century ago, in the USA, and even longer ago in the rest of western society, virtually everyone had a church within walking distance. Today, virtually everyone has a Starbucks within walking distance.</p>
	
	<p>Did you know that the greek word for "church", which is "ecclesia", actually existed before Christianity. In the Greek world, it simply means "community". So what if we re-promoted local "community" by using Starbuck locations as our club houses? That's what this site plans to do, and we'll use the somewhat humorous phrase "The Church of Starbcks" to do so. But make no mistake. This is a serious attempt to help build local communities</p>
	
	<p>Right now, you can express your interest by following the <a href="https://twitter.com/ChurchStarbucks" target="_blank">@ChurchStarbucks</a> Twitter account (Sorry, Twitter only allows 15 character names, so we couldn't get @ChurchOfStarbucks which would have been so much cooler). Soon, we'll start to explain how we intend to build this community.</p>
