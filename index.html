	<p>The internet has enabled many online communities. What if we wanted to extend these online communities to the physical world? We might want to start by building "club houses" in our towns, as various groups historically did, like the Elks, Masons, VFW, and Christianity did before that. But today, virtually everyone on earth already has a club house near them... it's called Starbucks.</p>

	<p>Did you know that the Greek word for "church", which is "ecclesia", predates Christianity? In the Greek world, it meant "community".</p>
	
	<p>What if we re-promoted local community using web tools and Starbucks locations? That's what this site plans to encourage, and we'll use the somewhat humorous phrase "Church of Starbucks" to refer to the concept. But make no mistake, this is a serious attempt to build local communities. Sure, we'll be able to gather together online, but we'll also use Starbucks as our home base... our club house... our physical meeting location... our church.</p>
