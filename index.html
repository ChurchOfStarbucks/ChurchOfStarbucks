	<p>The internet has enabled many online communities. What if we wanted to extend these online communities to the physical world? We might want to build club houses, as various groups did in the 1950s, like the Elks, Masons, and Christian churches did before them. But today, virtually everyone on earth already has a sort of club house near them already. It's called Starbucks.</p>
		
	<p>Did you know that the Greek word for "church", which is "ecclesia", actually existed before Christianity. In the Greek world, it simply meant "community". So what if we re-promoted local "community" by using Starbucks locations as our club houses? That's what this site plans to promote, and we'll use the somewhat humorous phrase "The Church of Starbucks" to do so. But make no mistake, this is a serious attempt to build local communities. Sure, we'll show you onine tools to gather together online, but we are also going to promote meeting together physically as well. And while we are going to promote people eating together at local restautrants, we're also going to use Starbucks as our equivalent of local churches, our sort of home base physical meeting locations.</p>
	
	<p>Right now, you can express your interest by following the <a href="https://twitter.com/ChurchStarbucks" target="_blank">@ChurchStarbucks</a> Twitter account (Sorry, Twitter only allows 15 character names, so we couldn't get @ChurchOfStarbucks which would have been so much cooler). Soon, we'll start to explain how we intend to build this community.</p>
