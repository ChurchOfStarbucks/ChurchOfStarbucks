  <p>Because Facebook is so dominant, many think Facebook IS the internet. Yet Facebook is just one site on the internet. One of our goals is to show you how to use the initernet. A second goal is then to build a community of knowledgable internet users.</ap>
  
  <p>This site is a work in progress, so if there is a difficiency, we will try to fix that once we learn of it. Feedback for that will take place in our Discord Server. Also, anyone is welcome to post questions there, and we'll provide support there..</p>
  
  <p>The basics we are going to talk about are (1) what a <a href="/blogging" target="_self">blog</a> is, and how to get one (with an RSS feed) (2) how to use a <a href="/rssreaders" target="_self">RSS reader</a> to read a collection of blogs you are interested in, (3) why <a href="/twitter" target="_self">Twitter</a> is a handy communication tool, and perhaps a better first level communication tool than email, and (4) how Discord, Slack, and other "<a href="/chat" target="_self">chat</a> with persistance" tools are a key to building a community.</p>
  
  <p>In the next few days, we'll fix some of the site layout. You can use the site completely on your own, but if you want to talk with us, and/or others, <a href="https://discord.gg/qhPHppA" target="_blank">use this Discord invite, and join the community</a>, so you can learn, and share with others.</p>
