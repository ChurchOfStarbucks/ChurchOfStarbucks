  <h1>Free blogging platforms (with RSS)</h1>

  <p><li><a href="https://twitter.com">Twitter.com</a> - If you currently don't have a Twitter account you should get one. It can be used initially as your blog. Later, it will serve other function, but since you will evenhutally need a Twitter account, you might as well start here if you currently don't have one. Plus, it's a good trial to see if your initeresed in blogging. If you can't blog a short 280 character post regularly, you probably are cut out for blogging. so, before you take the time and effort to set up a more complex blog. Try a little micro-blog first.</p>

  
  <p><li><a href="http://medium.com">Medium</a> - For complete newbies, I recommend this in combination with a Twitter account very highly. <a href="https://twitter.com/signup">Get yourself a Twitter account</a> first, and then immediately set up an assocated Medium account by identifying with your Twitter account. If your Twitter acount is @BobSmith your Medium blog URL will then be set up as medium.com/@BobSmith, and your RSS URL will automatically medium.com/feed/@BobSmith</p>
  
  <p><li><a href="http://wordpress.com">WordPress</a> - One of the most popular blogging platforms. Also, one of the more complex. Perhaps a good platform once you're experienced, but not the best platform to learn with.</p>
  
  <p><li><a href="http://blogspot.com">Blogger / blogspot</a> - owned by Google. Easier to use. Few downsides.</p>
  
  <p><li><a href="http://tumblr.com">Tumblr</a> - Originally bought by Yahoo, then sold to Verizon. Perhaps the easiest of all to use. A fine starter blog.</p>
