  <p>If it's a community, you'll come & go as you do any other club house. This is how I use Discord, Slack, and the other community chat's I participate in. I stop in once a day, see what's happened in the last 24 hours and respond to folks that have contacted me within the last day. If others are there while I'm doing this, I can chat with them real time, and since people are very regular in their schedule, I see some of the same people each day that visit the community at the same time. But Some folks, I almost never see in person, but use the community more like a forum. </p>
    
    <p>But, if you're using the chat one to one, the issue becomes how do you get alerted to the fact that someone is trying to chat with you. I recommend that you move to chat as an extension of Twitter/Facebook, and pass the URL for the 1-1 chat via a Twitter Direct Message or Facebook Messenger. Personally... when I am online with my Chromebook, I pretty much have a browser window open, and use a Chrome extension that shows me if someone posts a tweet at me. The browser will show an alert with a maximum of 5 minutes. So, if I get a tweet, and tweet back to that person, and they want to talk further, I can then send them a DM with a hack.chat or tlk.io url to them, so only they see it. Then I can can meet them in that chat and talk in depth.</p>
